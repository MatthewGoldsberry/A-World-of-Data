## Visualization Goal

The goal of the visulations generated for this project are going to try to help the user understand some various environmental impacts on health, specifically life expectancy and happiness. 

**Important**: When choosing the specific datasets there will have to be exercised caution to make sure that these enviornmental factors are as isolated from other things that impact life expectancy and happiness because there are some other major things that can have an impact on the life expectancy and happiness such as if the country is a first world vs third world country etc.
